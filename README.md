This app was created after i purchased a new shiny HP laser jet and found out afterwards, that the piece of shit does not support duplex scanning. 
Therefore, after scanning two-sided printed documents using the ADF, i ended up with two PDF files:
- one pdf of all odd page numbers (1, 3, 5, 7 etc), all pages facing up.
- the second pdf of the second batch scan of all even page numbers in reverse order (8, 6, 4, 2 etc), all pages facing up after flipping the document stack.
- and no simple way to merge these two files (for free). HP seems to not bother adding such simple yet fundamentally important features into their apps.

With this simple app, 
- these two stacks can be selected (remembers last directory and auto-preselect the newest two pdfs, in order of created time stamp, assuming everyone starts scanning the 'first' page)
- then simply pressing the merge button to create a merged pdf file in the same directory.
- Optionally, the input pdfs can be automatically removed and the reverse function can be disabled.

Installation:
- download the MSI and double click it. You can find the shortcut on your desktop and in the start menu.
